# Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning

This project uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for sentiment and emotion analysis on online platforms like Twitter. It classifies text as **positive, negative, or neutral**, tracks emotional trends, and identifies potential signs of harassment or distress.


## ✨ Features
- Fine-tuned BERT model for accurate sentiment classification  
- Real-time sentiment and emotion detection  
- Handles code-mixed/multilingual content  
- Visualizations: sentiment distribution, confusion matrix, word clouds, and trend graphs  
- Modular design for easy scalability and integration
